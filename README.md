# ENGG4930C(SIGHT) ForeSee Database Structuer

HKUST Spring 2020, Hong Kong Eye Health Tracking Application

## Introduction

ForeSee is an application for tracking of eye health metrics such as myopia. This repository contains the structure of database for the project. Database can be created in any MySQL environment but in order to be compatible with the [ForeSee API](https://github.com/DoguD/ENGG4930C-ForeSee-api) it needs to be created in an [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/).

## Getting Started

1. Create an AWS MySQL RDS instance. [Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.html)
